## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# source("./Code/my_rf_cv.R"), didn't figure this out, sorry

my_penguins <- read_csv("./Data/my_penguins.csv")
my_gapminder <- read_csv("./Data/my_gapminder.csv")
```


```{r}

```
